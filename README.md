# Acknowledgements
Many thanks to TAs Hunter Hollis, Sam Espe, and Randy for pointing out that this assignment would be very similar to our class excersise activity,
(Activity 06-Stu_CreditCardChecker-CellComparison). Reviewing this class excercise helped tremendously as I worked on this assignment.

I also wish to acknowledge the code source for the initial sub (executing the macro on all sheets) I found this at:
https://github.com/davidjaimes/yearly-stock-market-analysis

Lastly, I consulted the following website for guidance on creating the tble for the Stocks with the Greatest % Increase, % Decrease, and Total Volume section:
